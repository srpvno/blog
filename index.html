            <p> 
                So where am I now? <br><br>
                
                Currently, I'm in my final year of college. I'm an intern at an Intellectual Property software firm and finally realized what I want to do next. My ultimate goal is to become a cyber-security analyst and thus, I'm working in the right path for it. I just had to talk to the right person in the company, and that was it; "This is how you CAN do it". <br><br>
                
                The biggest struggle I had, was trying to figure out how to get in the field in the first place. Back in freshman year, I was a slow learner when it came to coding. And now, I'm building mini projects left and right during my spare time. Whether it be working on my website, building web scrapers for both basic webpages and pages with that require login authentication, breaking into virtual systems with the Metasploit framework (or at least trying to), and struggling to cram for the Network+ and Security+ cert exams. <br><br>
                
                It's taken a while, but I love it. I was never a fan of deadlines. Instead, I always preferred doing things in my own time as well as creating stuff for myself. Just like music. I'll place it out on a public platform, but I won't market it towards everyone. It's just there so that it can be there. For me. <br><br>
                
                And now that my final year is closing in, I've been looking towards the next step on ways to keep moving up in the field. The plan is to look for work as a Network Engineer. It may not seem like much, but I can say with confidence that 70% of CyberSecurity relies on the foundations of networks. I've grabbed experience with Linux and currently learning UNIX from another employee in my current company. My supervisor has been instrumental with helping me with PowerShell and Python scripting for administration and networking. And then my managers and CIO have been supportive by allowing me into their meetings on new projects or SIEM incidents. <br><br>
                
                But the field of CyberSecurity wasn't just about being able to program. Some folks here work in the field in relation to Risk and Compliance. It may sound boring, having to deal with legal logistics, compliance with ISO standards and ensuring company standards meet the requirements of contract deals, but it's a huge part of it too. <br><br>
                
                And I'm having fun, weirdly enough. <br><br>
                
                And so as I look forth into moving further up into the field, I hope things start to get clearer. I'm hoping for challenges on the way to keep me motivated. I'm hoping I don't get too distracted by people's opinions. I'm hoping it works out.<br><br>
                
                Throughout college, I was not an "A" student. In fact, my first semester, I was a "D" student. And although on the verge of academic probation, I loved that I started that way. Because, that taught me, that I could make mistakes for 4 more years while at the same time improving and learning from those same mistakes. <br><br>
                
                I got the chance to grab my own time to think and figure out who I was, outside of a relationship. I got the chance to arrive 45 minutes late to a final exam (1-hour exam) and still get a 90% on it. I got the chance to switch my major 4 times. I got the chance to meet people I liked and people I disliked. I got the chance to try and create a start-up, which failed immediately. I got the chance, to meet CEO's from various companies. I got the chance to arrive on the first day of my internship all sweaty and gross. I got the chance to penny-board by the Charles river every morning to work. I got the chance to travel to New York and understand what all the hype was all about. <br><br>
                
                Most importantly, I got the chance to make mistakes. <br><br>
                
                And although it's been rough at times, where I had nights I just wanted to run away from everything, I got the chance to be fully vulnerable and value the support from my parents and sponsors back home. Because I got the chance to experience so much more than what I thought. In fact, I had certain expectations before I started, and HOLY CR** the reality was totally off at a different tangent. <br><br> 
                
                So I guess Jupiter won't see me any time soon. <br><br>
                
                In fact, it'll take a while for me to get there.

            <hr>
            <p> I posted the "every day even now" video around the end of summer. Hoping it would grab at least some traction to the ambedo album. <br> Just enough to have a few critics hear my side of the story. <br><br>

                Because both sides can be very different. <br><br>

                For me, ambedo was about spontaneity in the moment. Being who you want to be during that one deep trance you have when you look at something beautiful or playing back one of those unforgettable memories. It was about being vulnerable with the music and venting out everything I felt during those multiple 3 a.m. sessions. <br><br>

                Because that's what they were. <br><br>

                But more so, ambedo is a story. My story. From my point of view. Each one of us carries an alter ego. Whether we believe in it or not. And at times, although contradictory and counter-intuitive, there are times where I feel that they are the same thing. Or at least everyone pretends they're to be separate entities. I've noticed times when I'm constantly chasing for something. Unsure as to where it would take me. Knowing that deep inside, it feels like the right path even though the fear of uncertainty revolves around it. <br><br>

                And the path forward never feels right when all we do is go up. And as we all struggle to climb the same ladder, for some, taking one step back is like crashing down into an abyss. When you're so used to that feeling, it's so easy to feel down. <br><br>

                And that's where ambedo truly comes in. In the moments of doubt. Struggle. And pure vulnerability. <br><br>

                And the deeper it sinks in, the easier it is to let gravity do the rest of the work for you. <br><br> <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> <br>

            <p> It's been 3 years. <br><br>
                And there's so much that has changed. No matter the variables present, I find myself bumping into a constant; the feeling I get when I look back. Even if it's just a glance. <br><br>And it's not to say that I haven't moved on. I have. It's just not the way I expected it would feel. I hoped the every time I'd peek into the past that it would be one of those rocking-on-a-chair-with-a-sunset-view vibes. Instead, I end up laying a tear. Unsure whether or not I truly miss it or not. Because I know that a part of me doesn't miss it. But I also know that it was the best a moment could be. So what's next? We're two different people now. If we met again, I'd probably not recognize her. You can't be in love with memories, can you? <br><br>

                Every day I make music, just to scratch it off my Pro Tools session over and over again, thinking that a supposed Eureka moment could happen. I thought that eventually I'd get to the point where I could express the feeling perfectly. That an emotion could give me a lyric or a ambient beat that would give me the perfect abstract sound. But touching on a past so sensitive means keeping it safe, deeply in the back of my mind. <br><br>

                And honestly, I think that's what it was. A sensitive memory. Bitter sweet to the point where it crushes you in the inside in such a beautiful way. Because it has no rhythm. It has no specific tone or word. It can't be heard. But it can be felt. <br><br>

                And that's the feeling I love the most. Playing it on repeat.</p><br>
