            <p> I posted the "every day even now" video around the end of summer. Hoping it would grab at least some traction to the ambedo album. <br> Just enough to have a few critics hear my side of the story. <br><br>

                Because both sides can be very different. <br><br>

                For me, ambedo was about spontaneity in the moment. Being who you want to be during that one deep trance you have when you look at something beautiful or playing back one of those unforgettable memories. It was about being vulnerable with the music and venting out everything I felt during those multiple 3 a.m. sessions. <br><br>

                Because that's what they were. <br><br>

                But more so, ambedo is a story. My story. From my point of view. Each one of us carries an alter ego. Whether we believe in it or not. And at times, although contradictory and counter-intuitive, there are times where I feel that they are the same thing. Or at least everyone pretends they're to be separate entities. I've noticed times when I'm constantly chasing for something. Unsure as to where it would take me. Knowing that deep inside, it feels like the right path even though the fear of uncertainty revolves around it. <br><br>

                And the path forward never feels right when all we do is go up. And as we all struggle to climb the same ladder, for some, taking one step back is like crashing down into an abyss. When you're so used to that feeling, it's so easy to feel down. <br><br>

                And that's where ambedo truly comes in. In the moments of doubt. Struggle. And pure vulnerability. <br><br>

                And the deeper it sinks in, the easier it is to let gravity do the rest of the work for you. <br><br> <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> <br>

            <p> It's been 3 years. <br><br>
                And there's so much that has changed. No matter the variables present, I find myself bumping into a constant; the feeling I get when I look back. Even if it's just a glance. <br><br>And it's not to say that I haven't moved on. I have. It's just not the way I expected it would feel. I hoped the every time I'd peek into the past that it would be one of those rocking-on-a-chair-with-a-sunset-view vibes. Instead, I end up laying a tear. Unsure whether or not I truly miss it or not. Because I know that a part of me doesn't miss it. But I also know that it was the best a moment could be. So what's next? We're two different people now. If we met again, I'd probably not recognize her. You can't be in love with memories, can you? <br><br>

                Every day I make music, just to scratch it off my Pro Tools session over and over again, thinking that a supposed Eureka moment could happen. I thought that eventually I'd get to the point where I could express the feeling perfectly. That an emotion could give me a lyric or a ambient beat that would give me the perfect abstract sound. But touching on a past so sensitive means keeping it safe, deeply in the back of my mind. <br><br>

                And honestly, I think that's what it was. A sensitive memory. Bitter sweet to the point where it crushes you in the inside in such a beautiful way. Because it has no rhythm. It has no specific tone or word. It can't be heard. But it can be felt. <br><br>

                And that's the feeling I love the most. Playing it on repeat.</p><br>
